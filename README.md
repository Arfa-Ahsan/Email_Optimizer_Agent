# Email Content Optimizer

## Overview

Email Content Optimizer is an AI-powered tool that helps users generate, evaluate, and refine professional emails. It leverages advanced language models and agent systems to ensure your emails are clear, actionable, and tailored to your audience.

## Problem Statement

Writing effective emails is challengingâ€”users often struggle with tone, clarity, professionalism, and ensuring their message prompts the desired action. This app solves the problem by automatically generating an email, evaluating it using an AI agent, and iteratively improving it based on structured feedback. The process follows the **Reflect Evaluator Pattern** for optimal results.

## Features

- Generate professional emails from a topic or instruction
- AI-powered feedback on tone, clarity, professionalism, grammar, and more
- Iterative improvement using structured feedback
- Suggestions for subject lines and actionable content
- User-friendly Streamlit interface

## Technologies Used
